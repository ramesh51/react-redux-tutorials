- Attributes are camelcase
- JSX will validate your HTML as you go
- state is immutable, it never changes, you have to recreate a new one

I struggled learning the React/Redux world and I am that this tutorial helps my kindred spirits. By the end of this tutorial you should have a runnable app that is all contained in one `index.html`. (You don't need to know gulp, grunt, burp etc)

## What you will learning

React/Redux, action creators, reducers, a bit of es6 if you don't know any.
